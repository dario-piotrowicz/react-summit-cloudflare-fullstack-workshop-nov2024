we'll also live code the various exercises solutions.

Each exercise has its own README file in the [./exercises](./exercises/) directory.

So if you're behind or in any case want to jump to another point of the workshop:

- stash or commit your current progress (in case you want to get back to it later)
- decide what tag you want to jump to
- run `git checkout -b <MY_BRANCH> <CHOSEN_TAG>` to create a new branch called `MY_BRANCH` that starts from the desired commit, you can then start working from there

> [!Warning]
> If you have some changes that are specific to you (for example binding data in the `wrangler.toml` file which we populate in exercise 02) make sure to copy those over onto your new branch
