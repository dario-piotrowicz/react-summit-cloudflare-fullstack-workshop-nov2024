# Business Logic Exercise

There are two variants of this exercise:

- `02-bindings-deployment/r2` (recommended): Sets up our configs to use Workers R2, KV, and AI. Using these services is free, but using R2 requires confirming payment information before being able to use it.
- `02-bindings-deployment/kv`: Implements the Workers KV, and AI. This section is possible without inserting payment information, but omits the R2 portion of the workshop.
