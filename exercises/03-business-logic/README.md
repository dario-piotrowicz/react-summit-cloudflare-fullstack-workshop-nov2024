# Business Logic Exercise

There are two variants of this exercise:

- `02-business-logic/r2` (recommended): Implements the card generation using Workers R2, KV, and AI. Using these services is free, but using R2 requires confirming payment information before being able to use it
- `02-business-logic/kv`: Implements the Workers KV, and AI. This section is possible without inserting payment information, but omits the R2 portion of the workshop
